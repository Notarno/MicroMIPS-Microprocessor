# MicroMIPS-Microprocessor
Implementation of a single cycle MicroMIPs Microprocessor

# Design:
- Implements basic fundamental structures of microprocesors which includes the following:
    - Program Counter
    - Control Unit
    - Instruction Cache
    - Data Cache
    - Arithmic Logic Unit
    - Next Address Block
    - Register File
- Produces 21 Instructions (ADD, SUBTRACT, LOAD, JUMP, etc.)
- Uses a variety of basic building blocks such as multiplexers and demultiplexers for
  connection between components

# Hardware and Software Used:
- Implemented using VHDL and Quartus
- No hardware has been used yet

# Limitations:
- Hasn't been tested on a FPGA board due to having too many pins
- Final design is implemented on a BDF file through Quartus
